# Intermediate English Scrapbook

I did this scrapbook as a final assignment of a Intermediate English Grammar. Its goal is make a scrapbook that can help to memorize and remember all the important content (that I think) of the course.

You can find here some util points based of Intermediate English Grammar, like definitions, important things to remember, and some cool examples that I found on internet. I hope this single web page can help you to remember this topics.
